    "#That way, since each box is an individual number, you can have something where if 1, 2, and 3 are ==, winner, \n",
    "#and so on for each possible combo. I think that it would also help to just make the user select a row and column instead of a specific square. \n",
    "#To help with the board, maybe you can start with something like user = 1, and then after the prompt of selecting your move, \n",
    "#you can make it so that all the boxes are 0 to start, \n",
    "#and then when someone moves there, it becomes a 1. \n",
