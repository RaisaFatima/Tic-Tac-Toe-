    "I put the user related functions and the computer related functions together to test them out for 1 round. It works but an issue I need to fix is that the comp overrides the user input sometimes and I don't want that. For example, sometimes I will put down a place as the user and because for now the computer is randomly choosing, it sometimes picks the same spot then overrides it. How to implement a check to stop that?"

    "#### Experimenting with if/else statements \n",
    "\n",
    "I have 2 chunks of code below. What I first did is that I wrote out every possibility that the user may try and win the game. Then I tried to write if/else statements based on responses to the user and how to stop the user from winning. So for example, if 1 and 2 have the user's marks, then the computer should put its mark on 3. Or if 3 and 5 have the user's marks, then the computer should put down a mark on 4 to stop the user from winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way I thought of doing this is by using + and -. So for example to account for the rows, 123, 456, and 789, I tried to set it up so that if the user place input, p, is equal to the square next to the square p, then the computer should put its mark 2 squares from where the user put it (e.g. if 1 and 2 are filled, then the computer will put it on 3). That is where the if/else statement if p==p+1 came from. I also tried to account for backwards stuff so if the squares 9 and 8 are filled, then the computer should put in 7. This is where the if statement \"if p==p-1\" came from. I tried to apply a similiar logic for the columns and the diagonals. I also did something similar for the \"in-betweens\" where if the squares on the sides are the same but there's an empty square in the middle, then the computer should put something in the middle to stop the player from winning."
